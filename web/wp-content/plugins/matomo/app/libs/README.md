third-party libraries:

 * HTML/Quickform2/
   - in r2626, php 5.1.6 incompatibility
   - in r3040, exception classes don't follow PEAR naming convention
 * Zend/
   - strip require_once (to support autoloading)
   - in r3694, fix ZF-10888 and ZF-10835
   - ZF-10871 - undefined variables when socket support disabled
   - fix #6980 ("Array to string conversion") in `Zend/Session/Exception.php`
   - fix Zend/Validate using deprecated iconv_set_encoding()
   - Make sure sessions work when storing notifications
 * materialize/
   - in materialize.min.css removed the loading of Roboto fonts as the paths do not match and couldn't be loaded. Also
     we do not want to load as many different font styles of Roboto font.
