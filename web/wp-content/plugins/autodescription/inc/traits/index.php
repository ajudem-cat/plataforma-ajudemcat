 * vayadhammā saṅkhārā appamādena sampādethāti.
 * - Siddhārtha (aka Buddha)
 *
 * (Roughly translated by Sybre:)
 * "Gather your [broken] pieces so you can make something [else] complete."
 *
 * In other words, when all seems lost, make the most of what you've got.
 * Or, when your home falls apart, repurpose the rubble and make a new home.
 *
 * This, of course, relates to "traits" in PHP: They are pieces of something that you must complete.
 * That's how I purpose all index.php quotes, if you haven't noticed yet.
